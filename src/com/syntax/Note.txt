Why we don't use our local/personal laptops/ computers to host websites and testing frameworks.
1) I have to keep my laptop up and running all the time.
2) Personal laptops/Computers don't have enough RAM CPU power to entertain huge requests
3) Internet connections are not that good
4) Security is also a very big problem when it comes to a host services on local machine,
for this reason we use servers.
5) Everyone can easily access them through their personal laptops
=======================

SDLC:
1) BAs discuss the requirements with clients and develop the SRS (Software requirement specification) documents
2) This document is then shared with Architects and QA Team leads.
3) Architects design the software requirement documents(SRD) and QA leads start planning the testing.
4) Once the SRDs are ready, developers start working(coding) and start building the application
5) This is where the deployment life cycle starts
    1)Once the application is developed on local/personal computers by developers they ask other developers
    or architects to review their code for any type of mistake and after that they push the code to
    the git or any other version control system once it is done
    they request the dev ops or IT team to deploy the application to the development server(Dev) so
    that they are sure application still works outside their laptops.
    2) QA will request Dev ops IT team to deploy it to QA server.
    3) If Everything looks good all the test cases are passed QAs will deploy it to staging server
    staging servers they are replica of production servers so that we can test the application is as possible
    as same environment as production
    4) If test cases fail QA will report the to Developer and whole cycle starts again
